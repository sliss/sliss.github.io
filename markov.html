      <p class="intro">It's not often that my interests in rhetoric and computer science overlap, but this being MLK
        Day, I was curious to see how well a simple Markov algorithm could emulate Dr. King's wisdom, given a collection
        of original MLK quotes as reference. Then I thought, "Why stop at resurrecting just one great 1960s' leader's
        words? Let's throw JFK in there too and see what comes out!" The two men lived in the same time, spoke on
        similar topics, and used similar syntax, making them excellent candidates for a mash-up. Some of the results
        were silly ("We must never succumb to the moon!"), but others were unexpectedly profound.</p>

      <p>May I present the words of the <em>Reverend President Dr. Martin Luther Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr., Version
          1.0</em>:</p>

      <div class="generated-quotes">
        <blockquote>Injustice anywhere is a menace to our security.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>A lie cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from his guilt.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>War is a poor chisel to carve out tomorrows.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>A lie cannot save the few who are rich. <span class="commentary">(From MLK: "A lie cannot live" and
            JFK: "If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich." A statement
            like this would find traction with the Occupy movement.)</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>It's always right to do the right thing.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>Human progress is freedom's road. <span class="commentary">(The computer neglects to mention the
            road tends to wind and often double back.)</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>We must accept the longevity of one's soul.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>We must learn to live in a nation of true education.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>History will have the final word.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>Nonviolence is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>Domestic policy can kill us. <span class="commentary">(JFK actually said "Domestic policy can only
            defeat us; foreign policy can kill us," but the computer's take can be read as a provocative statement on
            domestic inequality and healthcare policy in particular.)</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>Change is the law of liberty.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>A genuine leader does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous
          struggle. <span class="commentary">(MLK's rearranged words end up describing MLK.)</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>A genuine leader is not enough without illusions. <span class="commentary">(Computer-MLK has a
            cynical streak.)</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>Law and order [that] exist for the present are certain to miss the future. <span
            class="commentary">(The statement's wisdom is questionable, but the juxtaposition of contrasts is 100% MLK's
            style.)</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>Once you say you're going to settle for second, that's pretty important.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>Change does not roll in on the installment plan. <span class="commentary">(From MLK's original
            "Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle." and "A
            nation or civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on the
            installment plan.")</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>Rarely do we find men who can dream of things that matter.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>The ultimate measure of a man is not man. <span class="commentary">(Sometimes the computer model's
            penchant for nonsensical repetition actually produces some very succinct wisdom.)</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>We must never succumb to the moon. <span class="commentary">(JFK: space-age visionary, or secret
            werewolf?)</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>The goal of education is to teach one to think critically.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>There is nothing more tragic than to find an individual has not started living until he can rise
          above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the stars. <span
            class="commentary">(The computer model reconstructs JFK and MLK's words to produce poetic language of its
            own.)</span></blockquote>

        <blockquote>The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people, but the silence of our
          friends.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>Forgive your enemies – or else? The chain reaction of evil – hate begetting hate, wars producing
          more wars – must be broken, or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation. <span
            class="commentary">(MLK's original quote urges us to "Love our enemies – or else," but the change to
            forgiveness is a meaningful one. Even subtle shifts in wording can have significance.)</span></blockquote>
